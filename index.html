<h1>Who are you?</h1>
<p>I am currently a student at UNCG majoring in computer science (with a minor in English). I just want to work on my html skills since I first developed them in high school.</p>
<p><i>This site will act as a portfolio of sorts as I get accustomed to using github and maintaining projects.</i></p>

<div class="header">
  <h1>My Website</h1>
  <p>A website created by me.</p>
</div>

.header {
  padding: 80px; /* some padding */
  text-align: left; /* center the text */
  background: #775dde; /* green background */
  color: white; /* white text color */
}

/* Increase the font size of the <h1> element */
.header h1 {
  font-size: 48px;
}
