<h1>Who are you?</h1>
<p>I am currently a student at UNCG majoring in computer science (with a minor in English). I just want to work on my html skills since I first developed them in high school.</p>
<p><i>This site will act as a portfolio of sorts as I get accustomed to using github and maintaining projects.</i></p>
